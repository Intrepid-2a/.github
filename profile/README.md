# TWCF Intrepid experiment 2a

This GitHub organization collects the code for three experiments that are part of an adversarial collaboration to compare predictions from computational models / theories on spatial perception (Integrated Information Theory and Predictive Processing) in non-activated versus non-activatable parts of the retina.

### Project details

It is experiment 2a from this pre-registration: [https://osf.io/4rn85](https://osf.io/4rn85) in this project: [TWCF 0646](https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/0646).

### Tasks:

In short, we test the perception of space in 3 behavioral experiments around the blind spot (non-activatable) and other parts of the retina in the population:

- **distance** between pairs of dots
- **area** encompassed by a circular outline, and
- **curvature** in an apparent motion trace of 4 dots

Stimuli are presented either spanning the blind spot (first two experiments) or very close to it (third experiment) or at control locations equally far from fixation.

### Folder structureL

Individual tasks in repositories expect a certain folder structure and do not work without it. This is set up by the code in the `Runner` repository, see details there.
